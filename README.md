# simple-node-api-for-random-quote

A simple node/express API with a single route that send random quotes from the tv show Kaamelott.
it is used by [https://github.com/SebNoret/Kaamelott-random-quote-generator](this frontent app).
I created this project because the public API that was used by my frontend app in the beginning didn't handle CORS restriction policy.
